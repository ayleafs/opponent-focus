# Opponent Chat Focus
Basically for those who like a clean chat while they're playing but would also like to see messages from their opponents. This mod provides that, servers will be added in the future. As it stands right now (as of September 9th 2020) the only supported server is Minemen Club.

## Usage
It's not hard, just do `/togglechat focus` on supported servers.
